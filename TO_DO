- Comment/clean up:
  DONE: auxl, boundary, comm, eos, eos_var, eos_visc, eulerFlux, finitediff, grid, io_std_units, main_comp, math, nvtx, perturbation, rhs, rk3, table, timer, init, param,  interpol/main_interpol, interpol/auxlpol, post/main_post, post/auxlpro

- Actions:
  DONE: include input flag, grid, initial, and boundary conditions for channel flow
  DONE: add CFL condition with conduction for timestep limitation
  DONE: remove filter, mass diffusion, math_const
  DONE: re-organize cmpbulk (bulk properties calculation)
  DONE: Makefile with different compilers for CPU and GPU, print preproc messages
  DONE: include and GPU-accelerate recycling/rescaling and statistics
  DONE: create /preproc folder for initBL
  DONE: treatment of the pre-processing (init), from Matlab to Jupyter Notebook
  DONE: add in preproc/ the folder initCHA/ for the initial flow CHANNEL parameters 
  DONE: add constant viscosity and conductivity, -DCONSTANT
  DONE: create /src/unused folder for unused subroutines (backup)
  DONE: re-organize post-processing
  DONE: translate jupyter to python with jup2py

  TO DO:  
    1) test recycling/rescaling on multi GPU
    2) test channel at Retau=180 ideal gas
    3) add to src/unused rhs.f90 with LAD and massdiff, boundary.f90 with LST, eulerFlux.f90 with old KEEP scheme
    4) ...
