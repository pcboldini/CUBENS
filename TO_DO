- Comment/clean up:
  DONE: auxl, boundary, comm, eos, eos_var, eos_visc, eulerFlux, finitediff, grid, io_std_units, main_comp, math, nvtx, perturbation, rhs, rk3, table, timer
  TO DO: init, param, main_post, postpro, interpol/main_interpol, interpol/auxlpol

- Actions:
  DONE: include input flag, grid, and boundary conditions for channel flow
  DONE: add CFL condition with conduction for timestep limitation
  DONE: remove filter, mass diffusion, math_const
  DONE: re-organize cmpbulk (bulk properties calculation)
  DONE: Makefile with different compilers for CPU and GPU
  TO DO: 
    1) merge Ryo's modifications 
    2) treatment of the pre-processing (init): from Matlab to Jupyter Notebook
    3) re-organize the initial solution and the input parameters
    4) implement the look-up tables
    5) re-organize home
    6) re-organize post-processing
    7) ...
